# Auto-Billing & Recurring Payments

## 📝 Project Description

Auto-Billing & Recurring Payments is a decentralized smart contract system that allows users to subscribe to services and automatically pay providers at predefined intervals. It eliminates the need for manual invoicing and late payments by using Ethereum smart contracts for trustless, time-bound transactions.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The vision of this project is to provide a seamless and transparent recurring payment infrastructure on the blockchain that empowers users and service providers to transact securely, automatically, and without intermediaries.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Decentralized Subscriptions**: Users can subscribe to any service provider with automated payments.
- **Auto Payments**: Funds are automatically transferred at regular intervals.
- **Transparency**: Smart contracts maintain a verifiable history of all subscription and payment actions.
- **User-Controlled**: Subscriptions can be viewed or cancelled by users at any time.
- **Gas-Efficient**: Designed with optimized functions to reduce transaction costs.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Stablecoin Integration**: Add support for USDT, USDC to mitigate ETH volatility.
- **UI Dashboard**: Build a front-end for managing subscriptions.
- **Multi-token Support**: Enable payments in multiple ERC-20 tokens.
- **Chainlink Automation**: Use Chainlink Keepers for automatic trigger of payment functions.
